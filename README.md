# CPP-APP-8-

Hello everyone, this is an app that I've been working on, it's an app where you can search for a programming language and then it shows you examples of the code in that language.
The app also allowas you to change the background, it also has a dark mode. I wrote the app with Qt C++. Qt is a really good framework used for writing applications.

<h2>Light Mode</h2>
